title: Lightbox
description: Use tailwind classes with mini js to show this component. NOTE -> Logic & Design are not implemented yet. We can see an example of such a component here https://www.stimulus-components.com/docs/stimulus-lightbox. It might make sense to do this one later since it uses a custom lightbox library.
